# 🎉 Exciting Updates: More Fun! 🎉

Hey Pals! I'm excited to share some awesome new features with you:
<div class="my-12">
## 💬 Commenting is Here!
Now you can reply to someones response and then reply to that. (Don't forget to pick up the phone and call sometime too!)

## 🔗 Links That Actually Work
No more broken dreams... err, links! We now preserve your links in answers and comments. Just remember to use the full URL (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: underline;">https://</a> and all that jazz).


## 🚀 Space: We Need It
We're preserving line breaks in your answers and comments. So add that list of recs!


## 💅 A Fresh Coat of Paint
Enjoy some general design improvements.


## 🙈 Hide Empty Answers
Empty answers are now not shown. Less clutter, more focus on the good stuff!


## 🖼️ Images on a Diet
Images are now compressed and loading faster than ever!


## 🐛 Squashed a Pesky Bug
Remember that weird bug from last week with duplicate old replies? Yeah, I fixed that. Turns out switching servers without shutting down the old one does that. Lesson learned! 😅
